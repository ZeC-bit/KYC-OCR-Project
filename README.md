# KYC-OCR-Project

OCR is Optical Character Recognition which is deep learning Framework to recognize the optical characters.




## 4 Process of OCR 

1. Step 1 (Pre-processing)  
2. Step 2 (Text Detection)  
3. Step 3 (Text recognition)  
4. Step 4 (Post-processing)

**Accuracy, Recall Value of RNN** 

## 1. Preprocessing

* In the process of processing documents digitally, noise and distortion often lead to significantly lower recognition rates. => Can improve recognition rate through preprocessing
* Grayscale conversion
* Histogram normalization
* Redistribute the distribution of brightness to maximize contrast for clearer images
